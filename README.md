# Project Title: RacketSynth
### Problem Statement
The RSound sound engine is a powerful tool. It allows for the representation, reading, writing, playing and manipulation of
sounds. Unfortunately, it is rather complicated and difficult to use. Our plan is to simplifiy it's use by wrapping it with
a graphical user interface. This will be done using the Racket GUI Toolkit. 

### Problem Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the problem. Be explicit and succinct.

We will need to take the difficult process of creating particular types of waves at particular frequencies and abstract
in to simple procedures. These procedures will then be called by our user interface which will present a clear, obvious way to create sounds. 

### Data set or other source materials

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
How will you know if you are successful? 
If you include some kind of _quantitative analysis,_ that would be fantastic.

## Work Plan and Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. Write your general plan here. 
There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below. The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages, so take care in writing concrete steps for your schedule. 

In this general plan, and in the deliverables below.

### First Milestone (04-13)
We would like to have the user interface completed, though with very little actual functionality. However, any user actions in
the interface shoud trigger special test events so that we know the user actions are being detected. This could be a test as
simple as displaying a string in the interpreter when the user presses a particular button. 

This will not yet include any of the keyboard instrument functionality. 

### Second Milestone (04-21)
The user interface should now be able to call procedures that create sounds according to the user's specifications. The sound
creation should be achieved through simple, expressive procedure calls. 

We will also have the interface for the keyboard instrument working. As we will need to take keyboard input, a good test would 
be echoing whatever key is pressed in the interpreter, again, to make sure that user input is being properly detected. 


## Group Responsibilities
Here each group member gets a section where they, as an individual, detail what they are responsible for in this project. Each group member writes their own Responsibility section. Include the milestones and final deliverable.
